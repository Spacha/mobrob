# Mobrob

In this project, a mobile robot with remote control capability is developed. The robot will be able to wirelessly connect to Wi-Fi and sense the obstacles in its environment. The robot will be able to receive commands from the remote server, and send sensor readings and other data back to the server.

The system can be used as a base for a robot-based home security system, an in-home sensor platform, or with some improvements, even for industrial applications, completing dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks.
